&ensp;Plug in your phone using a compatible usb cable. You can browse through your files, and using the switches, you can validate which files you want to download.
<br>&ensp;But the main feature of the app, is being able to quickly select all folders where there usually are media like pictures, videos, sounds, and more. To do that, you just need to click on the "Recommended selection" button. 

<br>&ensp;Once your selection is done, you can download the files selected by clicking the "Download" button at the bottom of the screen. You will then have to select a destination folder. Your files will then be downloaded and ordered into 4 different folders: Pictures, Videos, Sounds and Other. A progress bar of the download will then be displayed.

<br>&ensp;In case of any error in the application, the refresh button could be useful. A night mode button is also always at the top right of the screen, and the night mode is automatically turned on or off according to the time.

One common error is that you did not allow the computer's fingerprint on your phone, and that is why no files are appearing in the app. <a href="https://youtu.be/38lkOoL9Jqc">Here</a> is a tutorial to fix that.
